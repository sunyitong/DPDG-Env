## Dynamic Periocular Data Generation (DPDG) Environment

### Introduction

The Dynamic Periocular Data Generation (DPDG) environment is a specialised synthetic data generation tool, designed to bridge the data collection challenges faced when working on periocular depth estimation in VR.

### Environment Overview

- **Platform**: Unreal Engine 5.2
- **Purpose**: Synthesize thousands of training images from a minimal set of human facial scan data, tailored for periocular depth estimation.

### Features

1. **High-Fidelity Synthesis**: Utilizes advanced rendering techniques to create lifelike periocular images.
2. **Customization**: The environment is adjustable to simulate various lighting conditions, facial expressions, and eye movements.
3. **Compatibility with Depth Estimation Model**: The synthesized data is pre-formatted to be directly compatible with our periocular depth estimation model.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Unreal Engine 5.2 installed and properly set up on your machine.
